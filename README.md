This repository is an implement of various methods of filtering and secondary signal processing in radar

## In this repositor you can find different variations of Kalman Filter, from g-h filter to EKF, UKF and others

## These algorithms help:
- predict the behavior of air targets
- helps reduce noise and smooth out the behavior of unstable process, allowing for a smoother presentation

The idea based on Bayes theorem and this is the main method for assessing the behavior of varios processes and objects in real life
